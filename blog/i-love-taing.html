          <h1><b>Why I TA (and Will Keep Doing It)</b></h1>
          <br>
          <p>Being a teaching assistant is the most rewarding job I've ever had. Here's why:</p>
          <h2>It makes me a better communicator.
            <small>I've had to learn how to explain the same thing in multiple ways: a diagram on the whiteboard, an analogy,
              sitting down and pair programming. How to leave constructive feedback when grading assignments -- more than
              just <i>please see solution</i>. Speaking up during TA meetings.
            </small>
          </h2>
          <h2>It makes me a better student.
            <small>When I write tests and assignments now I try to make them as neat as possible, because I know how frustrating it is
              trying to decipher someone's half-erased half-crossed out scratch work.
              I also like to think I've gotten better at taking tests -- having seen what good test questions look like and
              what kind of work is actually worth part marks.
            </small>
          </h2>
          <h2>It makes me think on my feet.
            <small>Students come with questions I haven't seen all the time: practice problems from textbooks, labs that aren't
              due for weeks, problem sets from previous years. That was really nerve-wracking at first, but it gets easier and it's usually more helpful
              for the student to hear your thought process if you sit down and work through the problem together. I'm so much more
              comfortable with being put on the spot (great practice for technical interviews)!
            </small>
          </h2>
          <h2>New friends.
            <small>Last term I took a class with one of my former TAs as well as one student I TAed! I've met wonderful people on each
              and every TA team (TA friends also tend to make very good project partners). I've gotten to know multiple professors
              just because I TAed for them.
            </small>
          </h2>
          <h2>I've learned how difficult running a course is.
            <small>Spacing out assignments. Managing regrade requests. Dealing with complaints and excuses. How much time it
              takes to mark open-ended bonus project extensions! How to assign marking responsibility to minimize variation in
              grading.
            </small>
          </h2>
          <h2>Seeing the look on a someone's face when they just <i>get</i> it.
            <small>High fives and hugs at the end of the final exam. Warm and fuzzy TA evaluations -- I thumb through mine whenever I'm feeling down. :-)
            </small>
          </h2>
