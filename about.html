          <h1>more about travel</h1>
          <p>The summer after freshman year my twin sister Jaden and
          I packed our 40L backpacks and hung out in Europe/the Middle East/Asia for four months.
          Since then, I haven't been able to stop seeking out that feeling of being an explorer,
          learning foreign swear words and touring local supermarkets (my favorite attractions). I've been very lucky to
          have had quite a few opportunities to travel for school-related business all over the continent! I can't remember
          where I read this, but we perceive time passing a lot slower when we do new stuff. So, to lengthen our time on earth,
          we must create as much change as possible. :)
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe at some point I'll blog about this, but it's actually quite easy to
            stretch your dollar on the road. The most common reason I hear from friends who wait to travel is that it's too expensive.
            That's just not true (considering how much it costs to live in Vancouver). Cheap travel is perfectly possible, and perfectly sexy.
          </p>
          <p>Here are some of my favorite travel memories so far:
            <br>
            sitting on the ponte alla carraia eating gelato from
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Restaurant_Review-g187895-d1749932-Reviews-Gelateria_La_Carraia-Florence_Tuscany.html">this shop</a> in florence,
            subathing on the beach in tel aviv, taking a nap at the national archives in paris, eating through the ningxia night market in taipei,
            marvelling at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sagradafamilia.org/en/">sagrada familia</a> in barcelona,
            strolling along the malecon in havana, making white toast and tuna fish sandwiches in tokyo, sunset hiking in cappadocia,
            feeding the swans in that river in zurich, enjoying a quiet morning on a rooftop in brooklyn,
            trying soutsoukakia at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Restaurant_Review-g580192-d1078621-Reviews-Scirocco-Naxos_Town_Naxos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html">this restaurant</a> in naxos.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you can see the list is ever-growing. :)

          <p>
            I'm classically trained and certified by the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rcmusic.ca/">Royal Conservatory of Music</a>
            in piano and have been playing since the age of 4. I have a preference for Bach and a life goal is to learn all of the
            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Well-Tempered_Clavier">Well-Tempered Clavier</a>.
            Two volumes of 24 preludes and fugues means 96 pieces, well, I'm 4/96 of the way there.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the school band I played the clarinet (badly).
            I started learning pipe organ which remains one of my favorite instruments ever;
            playing the Hallelujah Chorus for an Easter Sunday service was epically awesome.
            I also learned the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhu">erhu</a>, which is a Chinese fiddle.
            I joined an ethnic music orchestra and we always performed <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmZdbcIcy34">this amazing song</a>.
            I'll have to see if I can dig up our videos...
          </p>
          <p>
            In high school I was a soprano in the Magee Chamber Choir. We did many cool things like tour Spain and perform with
            <a target="_" href="http://www.rajaton.net/en/frontpage">Rajaton</a> and
            <a target="_" href="http://ericwhitacre.com/">Eric Whitacre</a> and

            I'm pretty rusty nowadays, but I'll find some way to get back into it when I'm not travelling so much. :)

          <h1>more about computer science</h1>
          <p>
            I got interested in computer science after taking the intro course at UBC. Before that, I'd never seen code before.
            I guess you could say I've just passed my 2nd anniversary of writing my first line of code!
          </p>
          <p>
            Last year, I interned at <a target="_blank" href="http://tasktop.com">Tasktop Technologies</a> here in Vancouver as a
            full-stack engineer. The product I worked on hasn't been officially released yet, but I built all kinds of new features from the
            front-end all the way to the back-end. I had
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tasktop.com/blog/recipe-for-an-amazing-internship/">a wonderful time</a> at Tasktop,
            mostly because my team believed and helped me believe that I was a capable engineer who could accomplish whatever I got my
            hands on.
